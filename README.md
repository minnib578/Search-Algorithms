# Search-Algorithms
The main purpose is implementing a number of search algorithms, which includes depth search,Uniform Cost Search and A*, to guide an agent through a grid-based world. For simplicity, we'll assume that the state space is 2-dimensional, consisting of the grid location of the agent.
